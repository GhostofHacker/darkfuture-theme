# Dark Future Theme

This is a color theme that using Blade Runner 2049 MovieBarCode colors and few other colors that I picked it out randomly.

    !!!As time follows some colors might changes and some other color supports might be integrated!!!

I am suggesting using ```vscode-icons``` along with this theme extension. 
    
    Vscode-icons for file and folder icons.

## Installation

Download this repository or download the folder called ```theme-package``` it contains a file called ```darkfuture-theme-2020.0.1.vsix```.

 After downloading the folder (```theme-package```);

* Open the folder via Visual Stuido Code.

You have successfully installed the theme extension.
Now you can choose the color theme at the extension tab.
